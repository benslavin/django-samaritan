================
Django Samaritan
================

This is a simple way to ensure that your Django applications can support
user models other than django.contrib.auth.models.User

Primary approach -- Dynamic Specification of User Model
-------------------------------------------------------
It introduces simple, drop-in, replacements for the relationship fields
ForeignKey, ManyToManyField and OneToOneField to be used when creating
references to a User.

Secondary approach -- Monkey Patching
-------------------------------------
There is also a method for injecting this behavior into models where the
author has not used django-samaritan on their own. This solution is not
a desirable long-term solution; however, wide-spread use of the
django-samaritan relationship fields will remove the need for this
approach.

NOTE: If you are using the monkey patching approach, samaritan MUST be the
first app in your INSTALLED_APPS.

Reasonable expectations
-----------------------
When using django-samaritan, it is reasonable to expect a User instance to
have all of the attributes, methods and properties of the django.contrib.auth
User model.

Dependencies
------------
The only dependency is Django 1.1. This may work with other versions of
Django, but has not been tested.

Installation
------------
For installation instructions, please see INSTALL.

Gotchas
-------
Monkey patching doesn't work for django.auth.handlers.modpython because of
the import scope.
